# Maze-Generation-Algorithms

We start by generating mazes using different approaches, where we are differentiating on various properties
like simply connected graphs, number of dead ends, convolution,
distribution of valency and complexity. The mazes generated are
random and unique every time you run the program. The goal
of this project is to understand the graph data structures at a
deeper level while enjoying generating mazes with all the different
algorithms out there. There is no universally ideal algorithm to
generate mazes, hence we will explore various techniques.With
the maze generated by the above algorithms, we want to delve
deeper into graph searching and traversal and hence would like
to challenge ourselves to implement maze solving algorithms
